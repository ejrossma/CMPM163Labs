#lab6 Shading in Unity

Lights:

Spotlight - Behaves like a flashlight or headlamp and lights based on the direction of the light, which is set by its rotation. It lights in a cone in the direction the light is facing, so position is relevant.

Directional Light - Behaves like the sun and lights based on the direction of the light, which is set by its rotation. Position in the scene is irrelevant.

Area Light - Shines in all directions to one side of a rectangular plane.

Point Light - Behaves like a lightbulb and lights based on location in the scene. Shines equally in all directions, so rotation has no effect on it.

How I made my Material - I used the picture that I took of my hardwood floor and put it directly into Unity and used it as the albedo map on my sphere. The result looked pretty good, so I messed with a few of the settings and found it ended up looking like a smooth ball of wood on the sphere and wood flooring on the cube.

Textures:

Description of Texture 1 (Wood Cube) - After creating my own wood material I was interested in finding some professionally done wood textures and putting them next to mine to show what mine could look like if I got good at making materials.

Description of Texture 2 (Brick Sphere) - I really liked how the brick sphere looked in one of the tutorial videos so I wanted to use a brick texture. I found one with a very good bump map to make the bricks look extremely realistic.

Skyboxes:

Description of Skybox - I found a skybox through the asset store that showed a beautiful sky with a sun about to rise, so I used it and adjusted my directional lights to align with the sun in the skybox to create quality shadows.
