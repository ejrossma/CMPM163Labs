What I modified:
1. I changed the material on the kart body to render as a fade so it looked more flashy with the current lighting in the scene.

2. I changed the colors of the kart and the player model.

3. I added the confetti effect given to us in the video to play at at the beginning of the race.

4. I moved more trees into the midde and made the scene smaller overall to focus more on the race.

5. I changed the color and form of the particle effect that I created for the wheels. Everything in the world seemed to be very round and soft so I made my particle effect to try and match that.
