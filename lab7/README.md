#lab 7: Mesh Manipulation

I couldn't find my partner through the discord, so I was unable to ask them the questions about lab7.

How I made my scene:

After finishing the tutorial for the noise mesh distortion on the sphere I decided to use the shape that I made as large rocks in the water around my scene.

I took the plane wave tutorial and messed with the size, speed, and color of it to make body of water around my mountain.

I also added a particle system to represent rain in my scene. I used the wave material for the rain because it made it look like the rain was being affected by wind and it fell more fluidly than the other materials that I tried.

The mountain was the hardest part for me. I ran into a bunch of issues manipulating a plane or cube to make it resemble that of a mountain range. I ended up toying with my different options and making a few different planes to create a simple mountain range.

I added a nightime skybox because I wanted to have a late night vibe in my scene since its always calming to me when it rains at night.

I also added some trees to the scene where I took the mesh manipulation that I used on the rocks and changed the color and angle of the Voronoi to make the edges look sharper.
