The changes that I made to my city based off of my inspiration:

I decided to use a cityscape from Futurama for as my inspiration. I wanted to have buildings that looked unique because they have some futuristic design or purpose that doesn't exist in most modern cities. I chose to not use the streets from the street tutorial because in the future they would use aircrafts to fly to all the locations in the city.

The actual technical changes that I made were changing all of the existing buildings to more futuristic versions and removing the grass texture because most futuristic cities that I see do not have a lot of plant life in them. The asset pack that I found ended up being sideways inside of Unity so I had to use the function Quaternion.Euler() to straighten them out.

Project Check-in with partner:

My partner used a beautiful picture of a nature scene as inspiration for their lab. It was a scene of a mountain next to some water with plenty of trees on the mountainside. They mapped the perlin noise onto a terrain that they created and made a cutoff point at a certain height so that they could represent a lake. They used different textures for the water, mountain, and snow and they did a great job.
